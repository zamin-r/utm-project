# utm-project
This is a UTM (urchin tracking module) that I built using Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. As I am more of a beginner for JavaScript, some of the code is not the most efficient. Nonetheless, this is a working UTM builder.


This project was the first time I used the Bootstrap 5 framework so I had a bit of fun trying to work with the different tools that I had for designing the UI. I also got the chance to study some more JavaScript.

The js/script.js file contains the code that allows the user to swap between the different screens
The js/options.js file is some code that I wrote to make sure that different screens did not show up when they were not meant to. For example, if someone selected the medium "email" and decided to switch over to "video", they won't see both of the screens on the next page for source. For some reason, that issue kept coming up and I decided to just go for a simple set of if statements to make it work.
The js/cookie.js file contains the main meat of code that puts together the UTM based off of the user's input. It was originally named cookie.js as I had a JavaScript cookies functionality built in which I got rid of for this upload as it did not seem to work as I wanted it to.

This project took me about three months to finish as I was doing a full time course load for my university studies.
